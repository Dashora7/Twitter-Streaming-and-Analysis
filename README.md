# Twitter-Streaming-and-Analysis
A repository for analyzing streamed Twitter data on Python

Use the streamer code for creating text files of Tweet JSONs. Run this script through the command line and wait for about 10 minutes to gather a large set of Tweets. Note that you must be a Twitter Developer and have keys/tokens to run the code.

The txt files should be named us_tweets and tweet_list so they match the analysis script.

The analysis will use these scripts and provide useful visualization about Tweets from the US and worldwide Tweets. Please remove the bounding box conditional for the streamer to get worldwide tweets.
